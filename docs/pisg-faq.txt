Pisg FAQ
========

My stats only show lots of numbers instead of colored bars
----------------------------------------------------------

You forgot to copy the .png files from the gfx directory (blue-h.png etc) to
your web server, or put them in the wrong location. If you right-click on the
numbers, and select "View Image", you will most likely see a 404 error message.
Put the .png files in that location.

Alternatively, you can use <set PicLocation="gfx/"> to set other path.

Can I use pisg as bot for my channel?
-------------------------------------

No. Pisg will only read log files that some other program has written. Pick an
IRC client or bot from the list of supported formats.
